# BusinessClassifier

## Setup

1. Obtain an API key from Yelp by creating an app (https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication).
2. Paste the API key from Yelp into '/data/api_key.txt'.
3. Add the data containing the businesses that you would like to classify to '/data/merchants.csv'.
4. Edit 'main.py' such that the business data is correctly passed into get_category functions.
5. You're done! You can now run 'main.py' and your businesses should begin to be classified.
